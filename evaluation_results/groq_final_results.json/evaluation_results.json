    "answer": "The average salinity of the Red Sea is a notable aspect of its unique characteristics. According to [1], the salinity in the Red Sea is remarkably homogeneous at depths greater than 200 meters, with a salinity of 40.6 parts per thousand (‰). This homogeneity is observed in the deep basins of the Red Sea, with the exception of areas with hot brines, which are characterized by very high salinity and high temperatures [1]. \n\nHowever, salinity does vary with latitude and depth. In the northern Red Sea, the seasonal variation in salinity is 1 ‰, while in the southern Red Sea, it is 0.5 ‰ [1]. Additionally, there is an increase in salinity with depth, with a greater depth gradient in the southern Red Sea due to the influence of low-salinity water from the Gulf of Aden [1]. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the salinity in the Red Sea has varied over time. During glacial periods, the salinity was estimated to be around 50 ‰ or greater, which is generally considered too high for coral growth [3]. In contrast, the current salinity levels in the Red Sea range from around 39.7 ‰ to 40.6 ‰ in the bottom water [5]. \n\nOverall, while there is some variation in salinity throughout the Red Sea, the average salinity is around 40 ‰, with a relatively narrow range below the halocline (150-200 meters in depth) [5].",

    "answer": "The Red Sea's high salinity can be attributed to its unique combination of geographical and climatic factors. As mentioned in [1], the Red Sea is characterized by the presence of vast deserts and the lack of permanent rivers, resulting in a net annual evaporation of 1-2 meters. This high evaporation rate, coupled with the limited influx of fresh water, contributes significantly to the Red Sea's saline conditions.\n\nThe seasonal regime, influenced by the Indian monsoon (as described in [1]), also plays a role in the Red Sea's salinity. During the summer months, winds flow from north to south, while in the winter, humid monsoon winds generate a net northward drift of surface waters, bringing in nutrient-rich waters from the Indian Ocean. However, this seasonal variation does not significantly impact the overall salinity of the Red Sea.\n\nAs [4] notes, the salinity of the Red Sea increases with depth, with a remarkable homogeneity of 40.6 parts per thousand (‰) at depths greater than 200 meters. The exception to this is the presence of hot brines, which emerge from the sea floor in areas with active sea floor rifts, characterized by very high salinity (exceeding 300 ‰) and high temperatures (up to 60 °C).\n\nThe lack of regular fresh water input, as mentioned in [4], is a crucial factor in the Red Sea's high salinity. The Gulf of Aqaba, in particular, is exceptionally saline due to the limited influx of fresh water and high evaporation rate. In contrast, the eastern side of the Gulf of Aqaba is less saline, likely due to the influx of Red Sea water.\n\nIn summary, the Red Sea's high salinity is primarily the result of its high evaporation rate, limited fresh water input, and the unique seasonal regime influenced by the Indian monsoon. These factors, as described in [1], [2], and [4], contribute to the Red Sea's distinctive saline conditions, making it one of the saltiest water bodies on Earth.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea's water circulation is a complex process, driven by a combination of factors including density gradients (differences in water density due to temperature and salinity), wind patterns, and thermohaline (temperature and salinity-driven) forcing. According to [2], the Red Sea is dominated by two types of currents: density-gradient currents and wind-driven currents. The deep-water current is generated by the density gradient, while the surface current is driven by the wind pattern.\n\nAs [2] explains, the density gradient generates a core of denser water masses with a salinity of 39 parts per thousand (ppt) and a temperature of 30 °C, which flows continuously southward out of the Red Sea through the Strait of Bab al Mandab. In contrast, during winter, the Red Sea surface has a low salinity of 36.5 ppt and a low temperature of 25 °C [2]. This northward drifting Red Sea water becomes denser as a result of salinity intensification and reduction in temperature, eventually descending near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and reverting southward beneath the thermocline depth (a layer in the ocean where temperature changes rapidly) of 200-300 meters.\n\nThe Red Sea's circulation pattern is also influenced by the formation of permanent eddies, as mentioned in [17]. In the northern part of the Red Sea, two permanent eddies dominate the circulation field: a small anticyclonic (rotating clockwise) gyre centered around 23.5°N and a larger, more elongated cyclonic (rotating counterclockwise) gyre centered around 25°N. These eddies are present throughout the year, although their strength, shape, and extent show some seasonal variability.\n\nAs [1] notes, during the summer season, the surface flow reverses, and a strong intermediate inflow of fresher and colder Gulf of Aden Intermediate Water (GAIW) takes place. This intermediate water formation is an important aspect of the Red Sea's circulation, as it helps to drive the deep-water current. The Red Sea's unique bathymetry (underwater landscape), featuring bathymetric troughs and basins, also plays a role in shaping the circulation pattern, as mentioned in [5].\n\nIn terms of the specific mechanisms driving the circulation, there is some debate among researchers. Some, as mentioned in [4], believe that the buoyancy loss (mostly due to the large evaporation rate) is the basic controlling mechanism of the flow, while others argue that the wind-stress field is more important in determining the circulation pattern, with thermohaline forcing playing a secondary role.\n\nOverall, the Red Sea's water circulation is a complex and dynamic process, influenced by a range of factors including density gradients, wind patterns, and thermohaline forcing. Further research, such as the studies mentioned in [3], is needed to fully understand the intricacies of the Red Sea's circulation and its role in the regional oceanography.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea exhibits a notable variation in temperature ranges, both spatially and seasonally. According to [1], the northern part of the Red Sea experiences a greater temperature fluctuation than the southern part, with average sea surface temperatures (SST) changing from approximately 22°C in winter to 29-30°C in summer. In contrast, the southern Red Sea has a more moderate winter temperature, rarely dropping below 26°C, and can reach highs above 31°C in the summer.\n\nThis temperature gradient is further supported by [2], which details a study in the Gulf of Aqaba, a region that can be considered representative of the Red Sea. The study found a distinct thermocline (a layer in the ocean where temperature changes rapidly with depth) in the upper 200 meters, with significant temperature differences between the surface and deeper waters. For instance, during summer, the surface temperature was around 23.8°C, while at 200 meters depth, it was approximately 21.1°C. This thermocline weakens with depth, and the temperature becomes more homogeneous below 200 meters.\n\nThe temperature distribution in the Red Sea is also influenced by its unique geography and climate, as mentioned in [3]. The air temperature increases rapidly south of 26°N, making the region near 18°N one of the hottest areas globally. This significant latitudinal temperature gradient contributes to the complex thermal dynamics of the Red Sea.\n\nIt's worth noting that these temperature ranges are part of a larger set of environmental conditions that make the Red Sea a unique and fascinating ecosystem. Understanding these conditions is crucial for appreciating the complex interactions within this marine environment.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea is home to a diverse range of coral reefs, with various types found along its length. According to [3], reefs occur on most of the length of the Red Sea, on both coasts, but tend to be at their best in the central and northern Red Sea, on the coasts of Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. This region boasts the greatest variety of reef types, with a total coral reef area of approximately 8,890 km2, comparable to that of the Caribbean [3].\n\nThe Red Sea's coral reefs are unique in that they thrive in extreme summer conditions, characterized by high temperatures, nutrient deficiency, and high salinity [3]. Despite these challenging conditions, corals in the Red Sea maintain thermal tolerance and growth. The region's reefs are also notable for their length, spanning around 2,000 km, making the Red Sea one of the longest coral reef systems in the world [3].\n\nIn terms of specific coral species, [2] lists several genera found in the Red Sea, including Goniastrea, Hydnophora, Leptoria, Merulina, Mycedium, Oulophyllia, and others. These corals are part of a larger community, with a total of 314 scleractinians (a type of coral) recorded from the north and central region, and 263 from the south [5]. The Red Sea's coral reefs are not only diverse but also support a wide range of marine life, with many species still to be discovered.\n\nThe distribution of coral reefs in the Red Sea is not uniform, with some areas, such as the Farasan and Kamaran Islands in the east, and the Dahlak Islands in the west, providing extensive reef habitats in environmental conditions different from those found at higher latitudes [5]. Overall, the Red Sea's coral reefs are a fascinating and complex ecosystem, with much to be learned from their unique characteristics and adaptations.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea corals have shown a notable resistance to bleaching, a phenomenon that has been observed and studied in various contexts [1], [2], [3]. To understand this resistance, it's essential to consider the unique characteristics of the Red Sea and its coral populations. The Red Sea is a semi-enclosed sea with limited water exchange, high salinity levels (ranging from 36.5 to over 41 parts per thousand), and warm water temperatures (between 21°C and 30°C) [3]. These conditions may contribute to the adaptation of corals to thermal stress.\n\nResearch suggests that coral species vary in their bleaching tolerance, with branching growth forms (such as Acroporids and Pocilloporids) being more susceptible to bleaching than massive or encrusting species [1]. However, the Red Sea corals have demonstrated a relatively high level of thermal tolerance, which may be attributed to factors such as coral genetics, morphology, or endosymbiont genotype [2]. For instance, some studies have shown that certain coral species in the Red Sea can survive and even thrive in temperatures that would cause bleaching in other regions [4].\n\nThe \"adaptive bleaching hypothesis\" proposes that corals can shift their Symbiodiniaceae types (the symbiotic algae that live within coral tissues) to enhance their resilience to environmental changes, including thermal stress [1]. This process allows corals to adapt to changing conditions and may contribute to their ability to resist bleaching. Additionally, the Red Sea's unique environment, with its high salinity and warm temperatures, may have led to the selection of coral species that are more tolerant of thermal stress.\n\nIt's also important to note that coral diseases, such as black band disease and white syndromes, have been reported in the Red Sea [5]. However, these diseases are not directly related to bleaching, which is a separate phenomenon. The Red Sea's coral populations have been studied extensively, and researchers have identified various factors that contribute to their resistance to bleaching, including their genetic makeup, morphology, and symbiotic relationships [2], [4].\n\nIn summary, the Red Sea corals' resistance to bleaching can be attributed to a combination of factors, including their unique environment, genetic makeup, and adaptive mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between corals, their symbionts, and their environment, but it is clear that the Red Sea corals have evolved to thrive in a challenging and dynamic ecosystem.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea is home to a diverse range of coral species, with [1] noting that 14 species are endemic to the region. Among the coral communities thriving in the Red Sea, some of the main species include those from the family Acroporidae (14 species), as well as other taxa awaiting revision. Specifically, [4] lists several genera, including Goniastrea, Hydnophora, Leptoria, Merulina, Mycedium, Oulophyllia, Paragoniastrea, Paramontastraea, Platygyra, Trachyphyllia, Cynarina, Echinophyllia, Lobophyllia, Oxypora, Sclerophyllia, and Acanthastrea. These corals are found in various habitats, from shallow waters in the Gulf of Suez to deeper areas in the Gulf of Aqaba, which reaches depths of 1800 meters [1].\n\nIt's worth noting that the distribution of coral species in the Red Sea can vary by location, with some areas having more diverse communities than others. For example, [1] mentions that the northern and central Red Sea coasts are bordered by fringing reefs of variable width, while [3] provides specific locations for certain species, such as Hindiyah and Shark reef. Additionally, [5] highlights the importance of considering the broader Red Sea area, rather than just focusing on the well-studied Gulf of Aqaba region, which represents only a small percentage of the Red Sea's total area.\n\nOverall, the Red Sea's coral communities are complex and diverse, with many species still awaiting further study and revision. By examining the various sources, including [1], [3], and [4], we can gain a better understanding of the main coral species found in the Red Sea and their distribution across different habitats and locations.",

      ]
    },
    "answer": "The coral communities in the Red Sea exhibit notable differences between the northern and southern regions. According to [1], the northern Red Sea, particularly the Gulf of Aqaba, is characterized by narrow fringing reefs that support corals down to the limits of the photic zone (the depth to which light penetrates, allowing photosynthesis to occur). In contrast, the southern Red Sea has coral formations mainly found offshore, such as around the Dahlak and Farasan Islands [4]. This distinction is significant, as the northern region's coral reefs, including both fringing reefs (growing along the coast) and barrier reefs (separated from the coast by a channel of deep water), support an exceptionally diverse assemblage of benthic invertebrates (animals without backbones, living on or in the seafloor) and coral fish.\n\nThe diversity of coral species also varies between the two regions. [1] notes that 14 coral species are endemic (unique to a specific geographic region) to the Red Sea, with some species, such as Javania insignis and Eguchipsammia fistula, being azooxanthellate (corals that do not have zooxanthellae, single-celled algae that live inside coral tissues and provide nutrients through photosynthesis). The absence of these species in the southern region could be attributed to uneven sampling effort or differences in habitat availability.\n\nFurthermore, [3] highlights a latitudinal gradient in the Red Sea basin, with calcification (the process by which corals build their skeletons) maxima occurring during summer in the northern Red Sea and during winter in the south. This indicates limited adaptation to local environmental conditions in the central and southern parts of the Red Sea. The division of the Red Sea into two Marine Ecoregions of the World, roughly at 20°N [5], may also reflect these differences in coral communities and environmental conditions.\n\nOverall, the coral communities in the northern and southern Red Sea exhibit distinct characteristics, reflecting differences in reef structure, species composition, and environmental conditions. These variations underscore the complexity and diversity of the Red Sea's coral ecosystems, which are considered among the richest and most diverse in the world [4].",

However, [1] mentions \"Contemporary patterns of Red Sea endemism,\" suggesting that the Red Sea has unique species found nowhere else. Endemism (the phenomenon of species being exclusive to a particular geographic region) is an important aspect of biodiversity.\n\nTo understand the context of endemism in the Red Sea, it's essential to consider the sea's characteristics. The Red Sea is a relatively young body of water, approximately 25 million years old [3], formed by the pulling apart of Africa and Arabia. This geological history may have contributed to the development of unique species adapted to the Red Sea's environment.\n\nThe Red Sea's environment is characterized by high evaporation rates, with an estimated annual rate of 1.50-2.66 m/year [2]. This evaporation rate, combined with limited freshwater influx, results in a saline environment that may support species that are specifically adapted to these conditions. The variation in salinity and temperature (thermohaline, or temperature and salinity-driven, conditions) could also influence the distribution and diversity of species in the Red Sea.\n\nWhile the exact endemism rate is not provided, the unique characteristics of the Red Sea, including its geological history and environmental conditions, suggest that it may support a significant number of endemic species. Further research would be necessary to determine the exact rate of endemism in the Red Sea.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea is home to a diverse range of endemic species, with approximately 25% of its fishes (around 275 species) found only in this region [1]. Some examples of these endemic species include the torpedo ray (Torpedo suessii), the dwarf moray (Gymnothorax baranesi), and the thread-scaled wrasse (Suculentophichthus nasus) [1]. These species can be found in various parts of the Red Sea, with some restricted to specific areas, such as the northern or southern regions.\n\nThe distribution of these endemic species can be influenced by factors like reef development, coral species distribution, and ecological conditions, such as water turbidity [3]. For instance, some species like the dottybacks (Pseudochromis) have restricted ranges, with some species found only in the northern Red Sea (e.g., Pseudochromis pesi) and others in the southern part (e.g., Pseudochromis sankeyi) [3]. Understanding the distribution and abundance of these species is crucial for conservation efforts, and studies have suggested that the use of technological tools, such as static acoustic recorders, can help gather data in remote locations [2].\n\nNotable researchers, like Dr. J.E. Randall and Sergey Bogorodsky, have made significant contributions to the study of Red Sea fishes, including the discovery and description of new species [5]. Their work has greatly expanded our knowledge of the Red Sea's unique biodiversity and highlights the importance of continued research and conservation efforts in this region.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea's high biodiversity can be attributed to its unique environmental characteristics and geographical features. As noted in [1], the Red Sea is a relatively young ocean, formed by an actively spreading rift, with only one natural connection to the Indian Ocean through the narrow and shallow Strait of Bab al Mandab. This isolation has played a significant role in shaping the environmental gradients, species endemism, and distinct evolutionary trajectory within the Red Sea.\n\nThe Red Sea's biodiversity is also influenced by its spatial and temporal gradients, which are characterized by high salinity and warm temperatures, making it one of the saltiest and warmest seas on Earth [4]. The presence of vast deserts and the lack of permanent rivers contribute to these conditions, with a net annual evaporation of 1-2 meters [4]. The seasonal regime, driven by the Indian monsoon winds, also affects the Red Sea's biodiversity, with a net northward drift of surface waters during winter and a net drift moving north under a superficial drift moving south during summer [4].\n\nThe Red Sea's endemic species, which are found nowhere else on Earth, are a significant component of its biodiversity. According to [3], the Red Sea has 14.7% endemic fishes, with 22 species found only in the Gulf of Aqaba, a region with a unique combination of shallow entrance and deep waters. The Gulf of Aqaba's upwelling, resulting from prevailing cross winds, creates a distinct environment with surface sea temperatures as low as 21°C, supporting a diverse range of species [3].\n\nThe Red Sea's coral reefs, which are found mainly offshore around the Dahlak and Farasan Islands [4], also contribute to its high biodiversity. These reefs provide a complex habitat for a wide range of species, from fish and invertebrates to microorganisms. As mentioned in [2], the use of technological tools, such as static acoustic recorders, can help gather data on species occurrence and behavior in these remote and often inaccessible locations.\n\nIn summary, the Red Sea's high biodiversity is a result of its unique combination of geographical features, environmental gradients, and seasonal regime, which have created a distinct evolutionary trajectory and supported the development of a wide range of endemic species. Further research, as suggested in [2], is necessary to fully understand the complexities of the Red Sea's ecosystems and to inform conservation efforts.",

    "answer": "The formation of the Red Sea is a complex and fascinating process that has been shaped by geological events over millions of years. According to [2], the Red Sea began to take form around 20-30 million years ago (Ma) as a result of the African continent (specifically, the Nubia plate) moving away from the Arabian Peninsula at a rate of 1-2 centimeters per year. This process, known as rifting (a rift is a zone where the Earth's crust is being pulled apart), led to the creation of a dry rift valley that eventually connected to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAs [4] explains, the Red Sea is a narrow marginal marine basin, stretching over 1,900 kilometers from Suez, Egypt, to the Strait of Bab el Mandab. The geological development of the Red Sea began around 20-30 Ma ago, making it one of the youngest oceans on the planet. Initially, the rift remained dry, but around 20 Ma ago, during the Miocene epoch (a geological epoch 23-5.3 million years ago), the sea poured in from the Mediterranean, marking the beginning of the Red Sea as we know it today.\n\nThe Red Sea's evolution was also influenced by hydrothermal processes (chemical reactions involving hot water) and the movement of tectonic plates, as mentioned in [1]. Additionally, [3] suggests that the presence of serpentinized rocks (rocks that have undergone a specific type of metamorphism involving water and heat) and ophiolite units (fragments of ancient oceanic crust) in the region indicates that the Red Sea may have originated from a past ocean, such as the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Ocean.\n\nThe Red Sea's symmetric structure, with an axial depression, developed relatively recently, as noted in [5]. This symmetry is characterized by the concentration of extension (the process of the Earth's crust being stretched and thinned) near the axis of the Red Sea. The establishment of this symmetric basin is believed to have occurred within the last few million years, with the relative subsidence (sinking) of the axis happening since the end of the Miocene epoch.\n\nIn summary, the Red Sea was formed as a result of the rifting process between the African and Arabian tectonic plates, which began around 20-30 Ma ago. The sea poured in from the Mediterranean around 20 Ma ago, and since then, the Red Sea has undergone significant geological changes, including hydrothermal activity, the formation of symmetric structures, and the concentration of extension near its axis.",

    "answer": "The Red Sea rift is characterized by several distinct geological features. One of the most notable is its varying water depth, with the shallow continental shelf being less than 50 m deep in the south, and the deepest water found in the central trough, which has a maximum depth of about 2700 m [1]. This central trough is roughly 50 km wide and is a key feature of the Red Sea's morphology. Additionally, there is a shallow sill with a depth of 137 m located in the north of the Hanish Archipelago [1].\n\nThe Red Sea rift also exhibits a unique morphology compared to other mid-ocean ridges due to the presence and movement of giant submarine salt flows (large deposits of salt that have flowed like a liquid), which blanket large portions of the rift valley and the oceanic crust (the outermost solid layer of the planet) [1]. These salt flows have played a significant role in shaping the Red Sea's geological features. Furthermore, the Red Sea involves large-scale geomorphological structures, including a deep rift valley, steep faults (cracks in the Earth's crust), highly tectonized terrain (areas where the Earth's crust has been heavily deformed), rifted volcanoes (volcanoes that have formed as a result of the rifting process), and bent volcanic ridges with overlapping spreading centers (areas where new oceanic crust is being created) [1].\n\nThe Red Sea is also home to a variety of tectonic features, including a crustal structure (the arrangement of the Earth's crust) that is characterized by oceanic crust in the north, which occurs in wide isolated areas [1]. The heat flow anomaly map of the Northern Red Sea Rift region, derived from aeromagnetic data analysis (the study of the Earth's magnetic field), shows several volcanoes identified from magnetic anomalies (variations in the Earth's magnetic field) [2]. The Red Sea is one of the youngest rifting basins (an area where the Earth's crust is being pulled apart) on Earth, with an age spanning from the Oligocene (a geological epoch 34-23 million years ago) until the Present [3].\n\nThe Red Sea rift has undergone a progression of rift phases, from well-organized oceanic sea floor spreading (the process by which new oceanic crust is created) in the south, to a continental-to-oceanic rift transition (an area where the Earth's crust is being pulled apart and new oceanic crust is being formed) in the north, and finally to an abandoned and largely exposed continental rift (an area where the Earth's crust has been pulled apart, but is no longer actively rifting) in the Gulf of Suez [4]. This progression of rift phases makes the Red Sea a unique and interesting area of study, and its geological features provide valuable insights into the processes that shape our planet.",

    "answer": "Conservation efforts in the Egyptian Red Sea have been underway for several decades, with a notable increase in activities since the 1990s. According to [2], the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) has declared several areas as national parks or protected areas, including Ras Mohamed, Nabq, and Abu Galum in the Sinai Peninsula, as well as Elba, Wadi El Gemal, and the Red Sea North Islands in the Red Sea Governorate. These protected areas, which include both terrestrial and marine components, enjoy varying degrees of protection, with some allowing limited tourism activities while prohibiting extractive activities like fishing.\n\nAs [2] notes, fishing regulations outside of protected areas also prohibit the fishing of sharks and endangered species. The enforcement of these protective regulations was previously carried out by rangers appointed by the EEAA, as well as the coast guard and the military. However, the current status of enforcement is unclear, particularly after the Arab Spring political uprising in 2011.\n\nIn addition to these government-led initiatives, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also played a significant role in conservation efforts in the Egyptian Red Sea. For example, [3] highlights the work of the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA), which has been involved in various conservation initiatives, including dolphin conservation. Similarly, [5] mentions the Red Sea Environmental Center (RSEC), which has been active in research activities focused on the ecology of mammals and sharks, as well as coral reef monitoring.\n\nMore recently, [4] reports on a scientific review of the coral reef bleaching event in 2023 along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea, conducted by the Nature Conservation Sector of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency. This review underscores the importance of ongoing conservation efforts in the region, particularly in the face of climate-related threats to coral reefs.\n\nOverall, conservation efforts in the Egyptian Red Sea are multifaceted and involve a range of stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. While there have been notable successes, ongoing challenges and uncertainties, such as the current status of enforcement, highlight the need for continued commitment and cooperation to protect this unique and valuable ecosystem.",

    "answer": "The northern Red Sea differs from the southern Red Sea in several key aspects. According to [2], the temperature range in the north is greater than in the south, with average sea surface temperature (SST) seasonal changes from a winter low of ~22 °C to a summer high of 29-30 °C. In contrast, the southern Red Sea has a more moderate temperature range, with SSTs ranging from a winter low of <26 °C to a summer high of >31 °C.\n\nAnother significant difference is the salinity gradient, which shows an inverse relationship with latitude. As [2] notes, the northern Red Sea has higher salinities (>40), while the southern Red Sea has lower salinities. This is likely due to the lack of permanent rivers and high evaporation rates in the region, as mentioned in [4].\n\nIn terms of geography, the northern and southern Red Sea also exhibit distinct features. The northern Red Sea is characterized by a narrower continental shelf, typically 15-30 km wide, as described in [3]. In contrast, the southern Red Sea has a much wider continental shelf, approximately 120 km wide. The seabed topography also varies, with the northern Red Sea featuring a central trough that reaches depths of over 2,000 m, while the southern Red Sea has a more gradual slope.\n\nThe division between the northern and southern Red Sea is also influenced by the seasonal regime, as explained in [4]. The Indian monsoon winds generate a net northward drift of surface waters during winter, bringing nutrient-rich waters from the Indian Ocean into the southern Red Sea. During summer, the winds reverse, and the net drift continues moving north under a superficial drift moving south. This seasonal pattern divides the Red Sea into two sub-basins at approximately 18°-20°N latitude.\n\nOverall, the northern and southern Red Sea exhibit distinct differences in terms of temperature, salinity, geography, and seasonal patterns. These variations are shaped by a combination of geological, atmospheric, and oceanographic factors, as described in [1], [2], [3], and [4].",
