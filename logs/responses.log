The Red Sea is surrounded by arid lands, which means it doesn't get much freshwater input from rivers or rainfall [2]. At the same time, it has a very high evaporation rate, kind of like when you leave a cup of water outside on a hot day and it quickly disappears [4]. This combination of low freshwater input and high evaporation creates a perfect storm for salinity to build up.\n\nThink of it like a big bowl of water wher", "confidence": 0.658095716860273, "latency_ms": 6704.239130020142, "session_id": "session_20260104_055329", "num_sources": 5}

It's really fascinating. These corals have developed some amazing strategies to survive in water that would be lethal to most other corals. \n\nOne of the key ways they do this is by controlling cell death during heat stress. It's like they have a built-in mechanism to sacrifice some cells to save the rest of the colony. This process is called \"apoptotic pathways\" or programmed cell death [2].
